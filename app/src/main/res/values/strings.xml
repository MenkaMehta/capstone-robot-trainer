    <string name="veg_diet_par1">Vegetarians are people who don’t eat meat and meat products. People may be vegetarians or vegans for ethical, environmental, health or cultural reasons. If parents are vegetarians, they may want their children to eat the same way that they do.</string>
    <string name="veg_diet_par2">For most healthy children and elderly people, a vegetarian diet can provide a nutritious alternative to a diet that includes meat. However, special care needs to be taken with children and aged people on all vegetarian diets.</string>
    <string name="veg_diet_par3">It is true that vegetarians do not intake enough proteins in their daily meals. To overcome this, small serves of protein should be included at each main meal. In this case, Beans and Legumes can be really helpful. Other suggestions: baked beans, lentils, chickpeas and humus, red kidney beans, butter beans, cannellini beans, borlotti beans, three bean mix, haricot beans and smooth nut butters.</string>
    <string name="veg_diet_par0">As you get older, it’s important to choosing healthy foods and enjoying eating as a social activity that you can look forward to. However, as we get older our lifestyles and appetite can change and this can affect the types and amounts of foods we eat. Intaking the right diet and good amount of nutrition can help you loose weight, prevent cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes. In addition, other diseases that can fade your life at this age, can also be prevented by eating a healthy diet recommended by our expert dieticians.</string>

In addition, other diseases that can fade your life at this age, can also be prevented by eating a healthy diet recommended by our expert dieticians.</string>
    <string name="non_veg_diet_par1">Non-Vegetarians are people who can eat meat and vegetables. They are not restricted to any kind of food. This can be considered as an advantage or sometimes disadvantage because they can end up eating a lot of unhealthy food.</string>
    <string name="non_veg_diet_par3">A suggested diet for senior citizens is presented by dieticians as follows: Protein: Eggs, milk, lean meat, chicken, beans and lentils are excellent protein sources to keep elderly healthy. Vegetables: Carrots, sweet potato, tomatoes, spinach, broccoli, cabbage, onions and avocados are the healthy vegetables to be included in the diet plan of a 70-year old. Fruits: Blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, kiwi, peaches, mango, melon and apples should be incorporated in a dietary regimen. Pulses and Grains: Lentils, chick peas, brown rice and whole wheat products should also be incorporated in a diet plan for elderly citizens. Nuts and Seeds: Walnuts, cashews, almonds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds and pumpkin seeds are healthy food options for old-age people. Fish: Salmon, mackerel, sardines, herring, tuna and trout are healthy food options for old age.</string>
    <string name="fruit_diet_par1">Fruits contain fiber, which can help lower your cholesterol and encourage regular bowel movements. Apples, pears, blackberries, and raspberries are examples of fruits high in dietary fiber. Oranges, red peppers, and strawberries are examples of fruits that contain lots of vitamin C. This helps keep teeth and gums healthy. Vitamin C also supports the immune system. Bananas, guavas, cantaloupe, and mangos are examples of fruits higher in potassium. Potassium can help maintain a healthy blood pressure and regulate fluid balance in the body. Oranges and tropical fruits such as mangos are high in folate. This can help the body produce red blood cells. Folate also supports healthy fetal development. Looking for fruits that are low in sugar? Try these. Black plums, prunes, and all berries are examples of fruits rich in antioxidants. Antioxidants limit the production of free radicals. They can protect your skin and fight off illness.</string>
